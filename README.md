Hotel booking analysis is the procedure of analysing the trends, patterns, and behaviours connected with hotel reservations. As part of the study, it is customary to gather information on hotel reservations, such as the quantity of reservations, the dates of reservations, client demographics, and the channels used to make reservations. After that, the data is examined for trends, patterns, and insights that may help hotels make informed decisions about their pricing strategies, marketing plans, and customer service initiatives.

The project involved investigating a dataset that consisted of two distinct types of hotels, namely city hotels and resort hotels, to gain a better understanding. In the given dataset there are 119390 rows and 32 column The columns have been categorized into three types, namely float64, int64, and objects. Hotel owners need to analyse hotel bookings since it helps them better understand their clients and make decisions that will increase their bottom line. Hotels may spot spikes in demand and change their pricing to optimise income by studying data on booking trends and patterns. Companies may customise their marketing initiatives to better target particular client categories by gaining insights about the preferences of their customers.

Hotel operators can do booking analysis using a variety of data sources. These include of internal data sources such website analytics, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and hotel management systems. It is also possible to leverage outside data sources to enhance internal data, such as social media websites, online travel agents (OTAs), and trade publications.

The identification of consumer demographics is one of the most important components of hotel booking analysis. Knowing the traits of travellers who make hotel reservations might help us better understand their requirements and preferences. For instance, a hotel operator can modify their marketing strategies to better target the young couples that make up a sizable portion of their bookings. By selling romance packages or planning couples' activities, they may also modify their amenities and services to better suit the demands of this demographic.

Understanding the channels that clients use to book rooms is a crucial component of hotel booking analysis. The income and profitability of a hotel are significantly influenced by the booking channels that guests use. As an illustration, bookings made directly through a hotel's website often result in larger profit margins than those made through OTAs, which frequently charge fees. So, based on the booking channels that clients use, hotel owners may modify their pricing methods.

Hotel managers can also benefit from hotel booking data by seeing trends and patterns in guest behaviour. Hotels, for instance, may see seasonal variations in demand, with more demand during the busiest travel times. Hotels can see these patterns by tracking booking data over time and modifying their pricing and marketing plans appropriately.

The study of hotel bookings can also help hotels pinpoint areas where their customer interaction strategies need to be strengthened. Operators of hotels can spot areas where they might not be living up to guests' expectations by examining comments and evaluations from previous guests. They can then take action to remedy these issues by raising service standards or increasing their facilities and services.

In conclusion, hotel operators must do hotel booking research in order to comprehend their clients more fully, enhance their marketing approaches, and boost revenue. Hotel owners may learn a great deal about the wants and preferences of their guests by gathering and examining data on booking patterns, client demographics, and booking channels. They may now alter their pricing, marketing, and customer interaction tactics to better serve their customers and increase income. In the end, hotel booking research may assist lodging establishments in remaining competitive in a sector that is undergoing fast change by staying ahead of the curve and adjusting to shifting consumer tastes and trends.
